    <title> Using GitHub, Git, and Webstorm </title>
    <title> By Caitlin D'Souza </title>
        <p> To begin, start by installing Webstorm with the following link https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ </p>
        <p> Then, download Git with the following link https://git-scm.com/downloads </p>
        <p> You must connect GitHub to Webstorm by launching the application and going to system preferences.
        Then select Version Control Git and make the path git.exe</p>
        <p> The next step is to create a repository. This can be done in GitHub by clicking on plus sign
    in the upper right corner and choosing "Create New Repository. Make it public, add the readme file, then press "Create."</p>
        <p> Next, create a repository in Webstorm by clicking VCS and Import into Version Control. Create a Git Repository,
        name the file, and hit "OK"</p>
        <p>To import a repository from GitHub, Go to the Main page, select Checkout from version control, then Git,
        then Checkout from Version control and then hit Git again. Type in the GitHub Repository name
        and enter the local path name. </p>
        <p>To create a file in Webstorm, go to the upper left side of the menu and hit "File", select
        HTML and then HTML 5 or File, and then hit Stylesheet.</p>
        <p>To add files to Git, save your code and press the "Add to Git" and "Add" to add this as a local file</p>
        <p>To commit your changes, go to the menu bar, find Git, press "Commit" and then add a commit message.
        Then, press "Commit" </p>
        <p>To push a change to a remote repository, click "Ctrl -> Shift -> K" and select the committed
        file. Then click "Push." The file is now visible on GitHub.</p>
        <p> To set up GitHub pages, go to Settings and check the repository name. Choose the GitHub
        Page Location by selecting "master branch." Now you will have a published URL to your GitHub account.</p>
